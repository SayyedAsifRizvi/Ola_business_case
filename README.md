# 🚕 Ola Cab Demand-Supply Gap Analysis

This project explores and analyzes Ola cab ride data to identify patterns in ride requests, cancellations, and no-availability issues. The primary goal is to uncover demand-supply mismatches across time slots and pickup points (airport vs. city) and provide insights to optimize fleet allocation and reduce missed rides.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The data shows a significant number of ride requests going unfulfilled due to either cancellations or no cars being available. The goal is to identify when and where the demand-supply gap is the highest and suggest practical interventions.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Analyze demand trends across different hours and pickup points
- Investigate reasons for ride request failures (cancellations, unavailability)
- Identify peak hours and imbalances in city ↔ airport routes
- Recommend strategies for fleet distribution and driver behavior management

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development and storytelling

## 📊 Highlights

- Created time slot categorization for more insightful visualizations
- Used bar plots and heatmaps to identify peak demand hours and failure points
- Proposed actionable suggestions such as incentives for airport pickups during early morning slots

## 📈 Outcome

Improved understanding of temporal and spatial ride request patterns, which can help Ola optimize driver allocation, especially during peak hours at specific locations.
